# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
bunx hardhat help
bunx hardhat test
bunx hardhat node
bunx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
